This repo is about computer programming based Problem solving using Algorithms and Data Structures. 

1) Basics of computer program execution
- Code segment      ( instructions  )
- Global segment    ( dat area      )
- Heap segment      ( data area     )
- Static segment    ( data area     )

2) Complexities
- Time complexity 
    - Time take to execute program
- Space complexity
    - RAM size used for running the program

O(1)    - one time
nlogn   - log n times 
O(n)    - n times 

2) Different types of logical Storage Mappings and their Implementations

List Storage 		
- Arrays, ArrayList, Set, Stack, Queue, DQueue, SortedSet,PriorityQueue,Vector,EnumSet,ArrayDQueue,

Linked Storage 	
- LinkedList, LinkedSet, LinkedStack?, LinkedQueue?, LinkedHashMap, LinkedHashSet, 

Tree Storage
- TreeMap,TreeSet

Hash Storage
- HashMap, HashSet,SortedMap,Hashtable, WeekHashMap,EnumMap

3) Thinking patterns used in Problem Solving 

Full Search
- The thinking process is to scan full data and come with results
Adhoc
- Based on the problem, come up with thinking approach and apply and see if it working
